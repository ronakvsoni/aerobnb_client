## Motivation

Nowadays, lots of people investing in a property. So, I wanted to create an app that could encourage Traveling and Hospitality Professionals to get profitable for their unused properties. I had been learning a lot about these topics over the year by seeing other hotels and apartment lease booking website used as examples for how they work, and I wanted to give that ability to any user specifically who want to host their property and who wants to spend some holiday stay at a different destination.

<br>Every user has to upload age proof document when they make a reservation so it can be signed by the host afterward.
